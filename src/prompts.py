User Question: "{user_question}"

TASK:
1. Identify the **Technical Intent** (e.g., "Persistence layer implementation", "Service initialization flow").
2. Formulate a **Refined Question** that is more descriptive and technical.
3. Suggest 5-10 **Technical Keywords** or likely symbol names (classes/functions) to search for.

Project Structure:
```

Question: {user_question}

RULES:
- Return 3-8 file paths that are most relevant
- Prioritize source code files (.py, .js, .ts) over docs/tests
- Use the Symbol MiniMap to be surgical. If a function signature or docstring matches the question's intent, ALWAYS include that file.
- For questions about configuration, constants, or specific model names/ports, ALWAYS include 'config.py' or equivalent config files.
- For questions about data storage, caching, or history, ALWAYS include relevant service files (e.g., 'services/redis.py', 'services/database.py') even if the feature sounds missing.
- For questions about security/auth, include auth-related files  
- For questions about features, include the main app file AND relevant service files
- For questions about CORS, middleware, or server config, ALWAYS include main.py

Return ONLY JSON array of file paths, no explanation. Example:
["services/auth_service.py", "routes/auth_router.py", "config.py"]"""

You are an expert developer assistant. Your task is to generate 5-10 search queries to find code relevant to the user's question.
Target tool: ripgrep (regex supported).

Project Context (Summary):
{project_context}
{structure_hint}
Strategies:
1.  **Simple Keywords**: Start with broad, single-word terms (e.g., 'platform', 'linux', 'windows', 'support').
2.  **Code Patterns**: Search for class names, function definitions, variable assignments related to the question.
3.  **Exact Matches**: Look for exact string literals if the user asks for a specific message or error.
4.  **Synonyms**: Include synonyms and related terms (e.g., for 'brute force' also search 'login_attempt', 'lockout', 'blocked').
5.  **Configuration Patterns**: For config questions, search for middleware, env vars, constants (e.g., 'CORSMiddleware', 'allow_origins').
6.  **Avoid Complex Regex**: Do NOT use complex regex (like `.*`) unless searching for a strict code pattern. Prefer simple substrings.

Format: Return ONLY the search queries, one per line. No bullets, no numbering.

    return f"""You are an expert code analyst. Answer the user's question using the provided code context, call graph, and project structure.

ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
1. **Targeted Files First**: Start by analyzing the code from the specifically targeted files — these were identified as most relevant.
2. **Context Awareness**: Understand where each code snippet fits in the project architecture.
3. **Function Relationships**: Use the call graph to trace which functions interact with each other.
4. **Call Chain Tracing**: When a function is relevant, identify what it calls (downstream) and what calls it (upstream).
5. **Root Cause Identification**: If the question is about a bug or issue, trace the dependency chain to find the actual source — not just the symptom.
6. **Look for Stubs/Mocks/TODOs/Dead Code**: 
   - Carefully check for stub implementations, TODO comments, hardcoded test values, or mock returns.
   - Even if a feature is marked as 'missing' in a README, check if service methods exist but are not 'wired up' (called) in the routes.
7. **Find Hardcoded Constants**: For questions about specific values (model names, ports, expirations), look for the actual string or integer definitions in config files, not just the setting variable name.

RULES:
- Always cite the file path and line numbers for your answer.
- If you find a function is causing an issue, trace its callers and callees to explain the full impact.
- If the answer is not in the context, say so clearly.
- Do NOT hallucinate code that doesn't exist in the context.
- When analyzing security or configuration, examine the ACTUAL values in code (not docs or comments about what they should be).
